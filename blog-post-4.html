					</p>
					<p>	Employing a combination of Python and C programming on the Raspberry Pi, I was able to effectively deploy custom manifest image to different E-Paper models. After testing various models of the E-Paper display, I was able to identify the model with enhanced hardware and software capabilities that facilitated significantly faster image refresh times. This breakthrough led to a substantial reduction in image write times, aligning with TMMCâ€™s production line requirements while optimizing cost. </p>

                    <h5 class="my-3">Machine Learning Life Cycle</h5>
                    <p>
                        In addition to improving the E-Paper display's performance, I developed a new application aimed at reducing downtime during hardware replacements. This tool allows team members to independently manage the replacement of E-Manifest hardware on the shop floor. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the initial requirement gathering to final implementation, this solution aims to streamlined operations and minimized disruptions, further enhancing productivity and system reliability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These advancements in the E-Manifest Project will not only help reduce costs and environmental impact but have also empowered team members with more autonomous and efficient tools, reinforcing TMMC's commitment to innovation and continuous improvement.
                    </p>

					<h4 class="my-3"> Configuring and Training Vision Systems </h4>
					<p>	At the beginning of my co-op term, I was involved in testing a crucial TMMC application known as the Team Member Rotation Application (TMRA). This application plays a pivotal role in integrating team member training, attendance records, process ergo burden, and more to create and schedule daily rotations for teams and processes in each quarterly shift.
					<figure><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/images/blog3/dataAnalysis.jpg" alt="image"></figure>
					</p>
					<p>	As the application improved and prepared for a new release, I actively participated in testing this application across different environments, including Development, QA, and Stage. This experience allowed me to gain a fundamental understanding of Java-based test automation tools like Selenium and TestNG. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with Azure DevOps, which proved to be a valuable platform for planning, coordinating development tasks, testing code changes, and ensuring the delivery of a high-quality software product.
					</p>
					<p> To monitor the application's performance during stress tests, I utilized Datadog, a monitoring and analytics tool renowned for its ability to gauge performance metrics. This software enabled me to oversee various server parameters, including CPU usage, memory allocation, disk latency, and more, under different load test scenarios.
					</p>
